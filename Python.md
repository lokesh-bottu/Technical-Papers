## Introduction to Python
- Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI).
- Python was first released to the public in 1991, and it has been growing in popularity ever since.

## Basic Concepts of Python
- Python is called as an interpreted language which means that the code will be executed line by line.
- Variables: Variables are used to store data in Python. They are declared using the assignment operator (=) and can be of any data type.
- Data Types: Python has a number of built-in data types, including strings, integers, floating-point numbers, lists, and dictionaries.
- Operators: Python supports a variety of operators for performing mathematical and logical operations.
- Conditional Statements: Conditional statements allow you to control the flow of your program by executing different code blocks depending on certain conditions.
- Loops: Loops allow you to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met.
Functions: Functions are reusable blocks of code that can be used to perform common tasks.

## Features of Python
- We can do the implementation with minimum lines of code
- Python is called Glue Language which means that we can merge Python with any other language also.
- Free and open source: Python is a free and open source programming language, which means that anyone can use it and contribute to its development.

### Strings
- Strings are immutable which means that we can't modify the string once it is initialized.
- But we can slice the string if we want.
- Usually the index starts from 0 to len(string) - 1. In Python we have a feature that is we also have a negative index which starts from ending i.e -1.
- We consider the elements which are in double quotes or single quotes as Strings.


### Lists
- Lists are mutable and can store any data type together. We can insert, delete or modify the lists.
- The Lists elements are also stored in the indexes starting from 0.
- We consider the elements which are in [] square braces as lists.



### Tuples
- Tuples are immutable, which means we can't modify.
- Tuples are declared in Paranthesis().


### Dictionary
- Dictionary consists of key value pairs,with irrespective of their datatypes.
- For every key there will be a value.
- The combination of key and value are known as items.
- Dictionary will be written in curly braces {}.
- The sets are also defined in the curly braces but the difference is set consists of unique elements this will be having key values, so there wont be any problem to differentiate.


### Functions/Methods

- We use function to get the easy effiecieny. We define a particular task in each function which we use when we have the same operation to be done many times.
There will be two types of functions 
1) User defined 
The users define these functions and can be named as per the developer wish.
2) Pre defined
These are built by the programming language itself and hence the developer cant change the name of the funciton.
