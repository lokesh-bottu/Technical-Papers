# Introduction to SQL
SQL (Structure Query Language), a programming language designed to manage data in relational database management systems (RDBMS). It is one of the most popular database languages in the world and is used by a wide variety of organizations.

- SQL can be used to perform a variety of tasks, including:
  - Creating and deleting databases
  - Creating and deleting tables
  - Inserting, updating, and deleting data
  - Querying data
  - Creating reports

- SQL is a powerful language, but it can also be complex to learn. This technical paper will cover the following basic concepts:

  - Relational database theory
  - SQL commands
  - SQL data types
  - SQL operators
  - SQL functions
  - SQL subqueries
  - SQL transactions

**Relational database theory**

- Relational database theory is a way of organizing data into tables. Each table represents a different entity, such as customers, orders, or products. Tables are related to each other through foreign keys. For example, the orders table might have a foreign key that references the customers table. This means that each order must be associated with a customer.

**SQL commands**

- SQL commands are used to perform various tasks on relational databases. Some common SQL commands include:

  - SELECT: Used to query data from a database
  - INSERT: Used to insert new data into a database
  - UPDATE: Used to update existing data in a database
  - DELETE: Used to delete data from a database

**SQL data types**

- SQL data types are used to specify the type of data that can be stored in a column. Some common SQL data types include:

  - VARCHAR: Used to store variable-length character strings
  - INT: Used to store integers
  - DECIMAL: Used to store decimal numbers
  - DATE: Used to store dates
  - TIME: Used to store times

**SQL operators**

- SQL operators are used to perform mathematical and logical operations on data. Some common SQL operators include:

  - +: Addition
  - -: Subtraction
  - *: Multiplication
  - /: Division

**SQL functions**

- SQL functions are used to perform calculations on data. Some common SQL functions include:

  - COUNT(): Counts the number of rows in a table
  - SUM(): Calculates the sum of all values in a column
  - AVG(): Calculates the average of all values in a column
  - MIN(): Returns the minimum value in a column
  - MAX(): Returns the maximum value in a column

**SQL subqueries**

- SQL subqueries are used to nest one SQL query inside another. This can be useful for performing complex queries that would be difficult or impossible to write without subqueries.

**SQL transactions**

- SQL transactions are used to group together multiple SQL statements into a single unit of work. This ensures that all of the statements in the transaction are either successfully completed or rolled back in the event of an error.
