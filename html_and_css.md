# Technical Paper: HTML and CSS


## 1. Introduction
- HTML and CSS are the backbone of web development. HTML is used to structure the content of web pages, defining headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more. CSS is responsible for styling and layout, enabling developers to control the visual presentation of web pages.

```html
<!-- Example HTML code -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
  </ul>
  <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
</body>
</html>
```



## 2. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
- HTML is the markup language used to structure content on the web. It consists of elements, each serving a specific purpose. Key aspects of HTML include:
- Tags and Elements: HTML uses tags to define elements that encompass content.
- Document Structure: HTML documents typically comprise a <!DOCTYPE> declaration, <html>, <head>, and <body> sections.


## 3. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- CSS is used to control the presentation of HTML content. It defines how elements are displayed, including aspects like colors, fonts, margins, and positioning. Key aspects of CSS include:
  - Selectors: CSS selectors identify HTML elements to apply styles to.
  - Properties and Values: These define the specific styles to be applied to selected elements.
  - Stylesheets: CSS can be included inline, internally within HTML documents, or externally in separate CSS files.
  - Cascading: CSS rules can cascade, with later styles overriding earlier ones.


```html 
/* Example CSS code */
h1 {
  color: #333;
  font-size: 24px;
}

p {
  font-size: 16px;
}

ul {
  list-style-type: disc;
}

a {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: blue;
}

/* External CSS file (styles.css) */
/* You can link this file to your HTML document using a <link> element in the <head> section. */
```

## 4. Conclusion
- HTML and CSS are foundational technologies for web development, enabling the creation of well-structured, visually appealing, and accessible web content.
- Proficiency in these technologies is a fundamental skill for web developers, and mastering them is key to building high-quality web experiences.
